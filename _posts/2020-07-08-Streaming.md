Hey guys, a short message to let you all know that I have decided to launch a streaming channel.(See below for the schedule)

As I am pretty implicated in the French and the English Powershell communities, I decided to start with a stream in each language per week. In a month or two, I will reflect back on this decision, and see how / if (?) I will continue like this, and make potential adjustments to this schedule.

- My first stream will be the tuesday 14th of July 2020 in French.
- The first one in english will be the 16th of July 2020.

> The central 'hub' of my streams will be located on github -> [https://github.com/Stephanevg/Streams](https://github.com/Stephanevg/Streams)
> I will keep all code I produce in that repo, You can participate influence on the content I will stream by creating Issues right [Here](https://github.com/Stephanevg/Streams)
